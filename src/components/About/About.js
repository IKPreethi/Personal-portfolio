            I'm a very ambitious Software developer looking for a role in an
            established IT company with the opportunity to work with the latest
            technologies on challenging and diverse projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a rich background spanning over 4 years, I've contributed my skills as a Software Developer in two prominent organizations â€“ SAP Labs India and Ernst & Young.
           </p>
           <p>
            At SAP Labs, I played a pivotal role in helping businesses of diverse sizes and industries operate profitably through SAP's intelligent technologies. My focus was on developing a cloud-based analytics service, a single solution merging business intelligence and enterprise planning with the power of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and predictive analytics. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Prior to my experience at SAP Labs, I contributed my expertise as a Software Developer at Ernst & Young - GDS. Here, I worked on a patented EY-Life Science Healthcare project, collaborating with esteemed clients like NHS, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, BMS, Roche, among others. The project aimed to create value-based contracting strategies, optimizing costs while improving patient outcomes.

            improving my chops one development problem at a time.
